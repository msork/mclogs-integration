# My fork's additions
I am planning to add Sponge API support (18.0.0 and up) which includes Minecraft 1.21.11 and up to the mclo.gs mod. If it works I hope to merge with the original repo to add Sponge support and become the Sponge maintainer.

## About mclo.gs

<a href="https://mclo.gs" target="_blank">mclo.gs</a> allows you to quickly share and analyze logs for Minecraft servers and clients. It highlights different log levels, removes sensitive information like IP-Addresses and detects common problems as well as version information.

## Features
- Upload server logs with a single command
- Share logs with a short url
- Automatic on-device removal of sensitive information like IP addresses and system usernames
- Uploading other logs and reports
- Deleting uploaded logs

## Commands

The Plugin/Mod contains the following commands:

| Command       | Arguments     | Description                                                   | Permission Level | Permission Node |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| mclogs        |               | Share the current server log                                  | 2                | mclogs          |
| mclogs list   |               | List server logs, crash- and network protocol error reports   | 2                | mclogs.list     |
| mclogs share  | \<file-name\> | Share a specific log, crash- or network protocol error report | 2                | mclogs.share    |
| mclogs delete | \<log-id\>    | Delete a log that was shared from the server                  | 2                | mclogs.delete   |

For special cases, the following commands are available:

| Scenario                               | Command                   | Behavior           |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Mod installed client-side              | `/mclogsc`                | Handle client logs |
| Plugin installed on a Velocity proxy   | `/mclogsp` and `/mclogsv` | Handle proxy logs  |
| Plugin installed on a BungeeCord proxy | `/mclogsp` and `/mclogsb` | Handle proxy logs  |

### Permissions

Commands are not available to players by default. You can give players access to the commands by giving them the 
required permissions. Plugin servers permissions use permission nodes for fine-grained access control. The `mclogs`
permission node is required for all other commands as well.

Modded servers use the Vanilla permission level system instead.

## Configuration
If you use a self-hosted instance of mclo.gs or want to use an alternative front-end, you can configure the plugin/mod to use your instance.
The config file is located in `plugins/mclogs/config.toml` for plugin servers and `config/mclogs.toml` for modded servers.

### Default configuration
```toml
# Base URL for the API used to upload logs
apiBaseUrl = "https://api.mclo.gs"
```

## Requirements
This project requires Java 11 or higher to run, even on Minecraft versions that run on Java 8.
